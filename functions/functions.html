    <h1>Functions</h1>

    <h2>Function:</h2>
    <p>Wrapping a piece of program in a value</p>

    <ul>
      <li>To structure large programs</li>
      <li>To avoid repetition</li>
      <li>To associate names with sub-programs</li>
      <li>To isolate these sub-programs from each other</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Function is created with an expression which starts with the keyword
      <em>function</em>
      .
    </p>

    <p>
      Functions have may a set of
      <em>parameters</em>
      , and a
      <strong>body</strong>
      -- which contains statements which are to be executed when the function is called.
    </p>

    <h2>Bindings and Scope</h2>
    <p>
      Each binding has a scope, which is the part of the program in which the
      <em>binding is visible</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      For bindings defined outside of any
      <em>function</em>
      ,
      <em>block</em>
      or a
      <em>module</em>
      , the whole program is the scope and such bindings can be referred from anywhere in the
      program. Their
      <strong>scope</strong>
      is
      <strong>global</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Bindings created for function parameters, or declared inside the function can be referenced
      only within function, so they are known as
      <strong>local bindings</strong>
      have local scope.
    </p>

    <p>Every time a function is called, new instances of bindings is created</p>

    <h2>let and const bindings</h2>
    <p>
      Bindings created with
      <strong>let</strong>
      and
      <strong>const</strong>
      can only be accessed within the block they are declared in.
    </p>

    <p>In Pre-2015 JavaScript, only functions created new scope with var keyword.</p>

    <h2>Lexical Scope</h2>
    <p>
      The
      <strong>set of bindings</strong>
      visible inside a block is determined by the
      <strong>place of that block</strong>
      in the program text. This approach to
      <em>binding visibility</em>
      is called
      <strong>lexical scope</strong>
      .
    </p>

    <h2>Function declaration</h2>

    <p>
      When the
      <strong>function</strong>
      keyword is used at the start of the statement, it works differently.

      <code><embed>
        
        function square(x){ 
           return x*x 
        }
</code>embed></code>
      This is a function declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function definitions are happily invoked even when used on the lines above their
      declaration. Function declarations are not part of the normal top-to-bottom flow of control.
      They are conceptually moved to the top of their scope and can be used by all the code in that
      scope
    </p>


    <h2>Arrow Functions:</h2>
    <p>
        Shorter form of function expression
        <code>
            ()=>{}
        </code>
    </p>

    <p>There is no special reason to have both arrow function and function expressions in JavaScript, except for a very minor difference (to be discussed later)</p>
