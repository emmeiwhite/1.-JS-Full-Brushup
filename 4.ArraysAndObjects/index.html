    <h1>Data Structures: Objects & Arrays</h1>
    <p>
      Numbers, booleans and strings are the
      <strong>atoms</strong>
      from which data structures are built. Many types of
      <em>information</em>
      require more than one atom though!
      <strong>Data Structure:</strong>
      A way to store information (values)
    </p>

    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>
      Objects allow us to group values - including other objects - to build more complex
      strucutures.
    </p>

    <h2>Arrays:</h2>
    <p>
      Suppose, we want to represent a
      <em>collection of values</em>
      say 2 , 3, 5, 7, & 11. One way would be to represent these with a string like this '2 3 5 7
      11'. But the retrieval and future actions performed on it is going to be difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      JavaScript provides us the data type specifically for storing
      <strong>sequece of values</strong>
      . It is called an
      <strong>array</strong>
      .
