    <h1>Rest Operator & Spread Operator</h1>

    <p>
      It can be useful for a function to receive any number of arguments. We do this with a rest
      operator ...
    </p>

    <p>
      We can spread out array elements as well. Calling a
      <strong>max(...numbers)</strong>
      function with three similar dots, now spreads out the array elements and passes them as
      separate arguments.
