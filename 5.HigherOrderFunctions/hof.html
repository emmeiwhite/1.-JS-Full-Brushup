    <h1>Complex Programs</h1>

    <p>
      A large program is a costly program, not because of the time it takes to build. Size almost
      always involves complexity and
      <strong>complexity confuses programmers</strong>
      .

      <em>Confused programmers inturn introduces(bugs) mistakes into programs</em>
      .A large program then provides a lot of space for these
      <strong>bugs to hide</strong>
      , making them hard to find.

    <h2>Abstractions</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Abstractions</strong>
      give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level, without
      getting sidetracked by uninteresting details.
    </p>

    <h3>Plain functions are a good way to build abstractions.</h3>
    <p>It is common for a program to do something a given number of times.</p>
